/* Create a class called Account to represent a bank account held by a customer (account holder). An
account is characterized by the private fields â€“ an account number (type String), the account balance
(type double) and the name of the account holder (type String). The Account class should have a
constructor that initializes the instance fields. Provide a set and a get method for each instance field. In
addition, provide the deposit and withdrawal method and a method named computeInterest that
calculates the interest earned by an account if the interest rate is 6% per annum. Test the class using the
main method showing the invocation of deposit, withdrawal and computeInterest methods. */
