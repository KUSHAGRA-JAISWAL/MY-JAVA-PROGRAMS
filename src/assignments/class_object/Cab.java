/*
Create a class called Cab to represent a cab on hire. A cab should include four pieces of information as
instance variables - a cab registration number (type String), name of the driver (type String), the rate per
kilometer (type double) and the total distance it covered on hire on a day (type double). The Cab class
should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for
each instance variable. In addition, provide a method named computeIncome that calculates the daily
income based on the total distance that it travelled on hire and returns the daily income as a double
value. The registration number and driver name must be available and the rate per kilometer and total
distance cannot be negative. Write a test application named Income that demonstrates creation of an
array of objects of size three of the Cab class and display the daily income from each cab along with its
registration number and driverâ€™s name.
